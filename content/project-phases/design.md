summary: Decide how we will meet all of the requirements.
---

1. Reference the requirements you are trying to meet
2. Lay out the logical "components" and describe how they will work together
3. Specify the inner function of each component
    1. You can delegate this to sub-designs with more technically-focused requirements
4. Specify what technical decisions were made and why
5. Address cross-cutting concerns (operations, security, extensibility)
6. Provide a breakdown of the needed work, with estimates of how much engineer time each step will take
    1. Get all the way down to individual tasks, even if it means making sub-designs
7. Get approval from all people and teams who will probably be involved in the work
