# Welcome

This is a place where I dump my personal thoughts on "standards for software engineering". These are not universal, but just a repository of available standards, why you might want to use them, as well as overviews to help tie it together.

## Overviews

Read these for a high-level understanding of how all the standards work together to support your project or team.

## Project Phases

Walkthroughs for individual phases of a software project. Links to all of the relevant standards and explains why we need them.

## Standards

Read these for specific recommendations. These will always link to the "why". Not all of these are applicable to all software projects.

## Principles

These are short statements to help you avoid pitfalls and identify opportunities. Many come with examples.

## System Archetypes

These are types of systems (and libraries!) commonly seen in the wild. Note that these will be skewed toward megacorporations and ML, since the majority of my work experience is focused on these.
