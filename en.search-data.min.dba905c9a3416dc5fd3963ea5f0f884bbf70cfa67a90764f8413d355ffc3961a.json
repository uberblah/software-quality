Release # Ensure the system is ready for release and meets all applicable standards.\nGet Customer Approval Complete Operations, Security and Privacy Checklists To the extent possible, these should be automated Not all checklist items are always relevant Define a release plan How will we execute the release? What could go wrong? What will we do about it? Get approval on the artifacts above Execute the release plan Operation # Operate, fix and improve the system.\nMonitor the system, manage an on-call rotation Mitigate incidents, if applicable Address customer feedback Fix bugs Plan improvements (these also follow the same lifecycle) Determine if the system needs to be deprecated (usually as part of a new project) Deprecation # Identify and measure impact of all affected customer use cases Identify any actions needed to migrate customers to a new system Make an inventory of all the components that need to be decommissioned Perform any needed migrations Shut down the system "}]
