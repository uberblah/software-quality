A personal aggregation of software engineering `{best practices, templates, patterns, principles}`.

# Why?

## Why not just carry around my personal best practices in my head?
- Sharing these with others requires better organization than "in my head".
- Revising these, and ensuring new revisions won't introduce conflicts, requires a review process.
- A well-documented checklist is the best way to uphold standards. It should be easy for anyone on the team to see if they are meeting the standard or not.

## Why not just make a team-specific one for my team?
- Not every team needs the same standards
- This repo defines my "baseline" so that I can adjust and specialize depending on context:
    - Personal projects
    - Work
    - Advice for others

## Why now? Why not sooner?
- I've relied on existing standards so far, present in the teams or organizations that I joined
- Now I find that there are a LOT of standards we could use. I need a "north star" to steer my team process contributions without making it "all or nothing".

# Requirements
1. End-to-end project lifecycle
    1. Flowchart
    2. Description
    3. Example projects
    4. For each process in the project lifecycle:
        1. Recommended workflow
        2. Standards to uphold (with checklists and "whys")
        3. Helpful tools
2. A repository of individually-linkable "whys", examples and how-tos to back up the checklists
3. A repository of individually-linkable library or system "archetypes" that you may see or need in the wild

# Disclaimer
All of the above is grounded in widespread industry challenges and practices.
1. It will not reflect any personal inventions conceived in the course of my work
2. It will not address challenges that are specific to any current or past employer, nor any solution considered trade secrets

I hope to provide value here by collecting all of this information in one place, in a useful layout for sharing.
